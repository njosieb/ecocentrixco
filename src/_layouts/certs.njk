    <p>Building Performance Institute (BPI) certified professionals are highly skilled experts in the home performance industry. BPI is a nationally recognized credentialing program that identifies individual excellence in "house-as-a-system" evaluation, diagnostics and installation.</p>
    <p>For many homeowners and tenants, energy bills account for far too much of the monthly budget. Stringent technical standards and requirements mean that BPI certified professionals are individuals who have been trained to meet these problems head-on. BPI professionals are certified in blower door and duct blaster operation, as well as testing and analysis of combustion appliances in your home.</p>

    <p>A home energy rating involves an analysis of a home's construction plans and onsite inspections. Based on the home's plans, the Home Energy Rater (HERS) uses an energy efficiency software package to perform an energy analysis of the home's design.</p>
    <p>Upon completion of the plan review, the rater will work with the builder to identify the energy efficiency improvements needed to ensure the house will meet ENERGY STAR performance guidelines. The rater then conducts onsite inspections, typically including a blower door test (to test the leakiness of the house) and a duct test (to test the leakiness of the ducts). Results of these tests, along with inputs derived from the plan review, are used to generate the HERS Index for the home. The HERS Index makes it easy to compare relative energy efficiency of different homes.</p>

    <p>The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) is a trade promotion that helps promote policies that make housing a priority. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that building in the US account for 39 percent of total energy use, 12 percent of the total water consumption, 68 percent of total electricity consumptions, and 38 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions. Certified Green Professionals (CGP) incorporate environmental considerations and resource efficiency into every step of the land development and home building process to minimize the environmental impact. Starting with lot development through the design, construction, and operations of a home, green building requires intentional decisions that positively impact energy and resource efficiency, as well as indoor environmental quality. The goal is to build the best, most sustainable and practical homes we can build for customers and the environment.</p>
    <p>NGBS helps builders, remodelers, developers and home owners/buyers build and understand high performance construction and development. A Green Verifier is the one who is present on the job sites and verifies that the work is being completed properly to receive certification. A Green Verifier is an expert in the 2012 ICC-700 National Green Building Standards.</p>

The tax deduction ends December 31, 2013. The maximum deduction is $1,000 per year or $2,000 cumulatively for multiple years. The audit must be performed by an energy auditor certified by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.</p>
